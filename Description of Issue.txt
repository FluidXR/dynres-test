There is an issue with the OpenXR composition layers, where when the source texture component is receiving a texture from a render texture. In this case the render texture is being updated from a camera in the scene.

It appears that the Composition Layer visual receives the first 2-3 frames and then repeats them on a loop over and over again. So the composition layer is just stuck on those frames and doesn't get updated past that.

This was tested with Unity 6000.1.5 & 6000.1.12 & "com.unity.xr.openxr": "1.15.0"

I've provided a Unity Project, a sample .apk with the name "OverlayTest", and an example video of what I am seeing. The video is recorded at 30fps and is missing some frames.

This is important for us for putting unity UI into an overlay and for certain rendering effects that our application uses.
